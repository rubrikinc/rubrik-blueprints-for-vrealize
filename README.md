# Rubrik Blueprints for vRealize

Contains use cases and blueprints for the [Rubrik Plugin for vRealize](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-plugin-for-vrealize). 

## Provision and Protect with vRealize
For the Provision and Protect use case, Rubrik can be integrated into existing or new vRA blueprints surrounding VM provisioning, requiring users to select an SLA Domain during the provisioning process. This ensures that each and every time a vRA catalog item is requested, data protection policies are applied to the newly provisioned VMs.

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-blueprints-for-vrealize/blob/master/Provision-and-Protect/README.md).
